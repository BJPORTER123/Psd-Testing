### Testing task 1:

# Carry out static testing on the code below.
# Comment on any errors that you see below.

Note that we are only looking for errors here.

**Not** any issues with, i.e.: 
Thinking that methods should be renamed or should be class level, or using string interpolation etc. 

These aren't errors but rather standards that vary from developer to developer. 

Only comment on errors that would stop the tests running.

```python

class CardGame:


  def check_for_ace(self, card):
    # '=' should be replaced with '=='
    if card.value = 1:
      return True
      # missing a : after else 
    else
      return False
   
# dif should be def 
# card1 and card2 should be seperated by a comma
  dif highest_card(self, card1 card2):
  if card1.value > card2.value:
  # return card should be card1
    return card
  else:
    return card2
  


def cards_total(self, cards):
  # total should be initialised to 0 'total == 0'
  total
  for card in cards:
    total += card.value
    # this return should be placed out of the for loop
    # in pyhton you cant join an int and a string so you must make the int a string : 'str(total)'
    return "You have a total of" + total
  
```
